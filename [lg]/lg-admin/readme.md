##lg-admin

An admin panel, used to make the server easier to manage.


To make a new function (button) in the admin panel, you need to:
- Have some basic knowledge of lua
- An IQ of atleast 10 (more is better👍)

You have to go into the `cl_main.lua` file, found in the client folder.
From there, navigate to the `lg-admin:openMenu` event.

From there, WarMenu is pretty much self explanatory.
