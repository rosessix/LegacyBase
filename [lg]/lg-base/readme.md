###The core of the framework.

**Do not change anything unless told to, or know what you are doing.**

The component system can be found within the `shared` folder > `sh_components.lua`.



The framework is only a "boilerplate" framework. This means, that if you have little to no knowledge of what you are doing, I recommend you to not use the framework.

Becuase of the framework being a "boilerplate", it is lacking alot of features.
This is because the framework is not meant to be a "complete" framework, and meant to up to the developer to add features, and make the framework more useful.
